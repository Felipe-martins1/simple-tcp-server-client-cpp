# Simple TCP Server-Client in C++

This is a simple TCP server-client implementation in C++. It demonstrates how to establish a TCP connection between a server and a client, and exchange messages over the network.

## Prerequisites

Before running the code, make sure you have the following:

- C++ compiler (e.g., GCC or Clang)
- Basic understanding of TCP/IP networking concepts

## Usage

1. Clone the repository:

2. Compile the server and client programs:

    ```shell
    g++ server.cpp -o server
    g++ client.cpp -o client
    ```

3. Start the server 1(Port: 8080):

    ```shell
    ./server
    ```

4. Start the server 2(Port: 8081):

    ```shell
    ./server
    ```

5. Start the server 3(Port: 8082):

    ```shell
    ./server
    ```

4. Run the client:

    ```shell
    ./client
    ```

5. Follow the prompts in the client program to send and receive messages.
